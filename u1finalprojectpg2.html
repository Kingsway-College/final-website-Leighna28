            <img src="images/shino.png" alt="_blank">
            <p>Shino is a lively deer villager. Her birthday is on October 31st, sharing a birthday with Jack and Label. She has a large interest in trivia and will overreact in conversations with that topic. She gets overly excited when seeing other villagers or players on the island and she never gets discouraged from doing anything, especially her usual hobbies. She's one of my favourite characters because she has a unique personality and character design that nobody else really has.</p>

            <p>Raymond is a rather organized cat that typically doesn't have a smile on his face unlike most villagers. His birthday is on October 1st. Finally, his favourite colors are black and grey. He is one of my favourite characters because he's funny, trustworthy and organized.</p>

            <img src="images/marshall.png" alt="_blank">
            <p>Marshall is a white squirrel that has his birthday on September 29th. He's known to have a “smug” personality. He doesn't find it hard to interact with other villagers or characters in the game and he's very polite and lively. Marshall is one of my favourite villagers in the game because he's calm most of the time and his character design is very cool !!</p>
